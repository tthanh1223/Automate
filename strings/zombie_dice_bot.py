Zombie Dice is a quick, fun dice game from Steve Jackson Games.
The players are zombies trying to eat as many human brains as possible without getting "shot three times."
There is a cup of 13 dice with brains, footsteps, and shotgun icons on their faces.
"The dice icons are colored," and each color has a different likelihood of each event occurring.
Every dice has two sides with footsteps, but dice with green icons have more sides with brains,
 red-icon dice have more shotguns, and yellow-icon dice have an even split of brains and shotguns.
 Do the following on each player’s turn:
    Place all 13 dice in the cup. The player randomly draws three dzice from the cup and then rolls them. Players always roll exactly three dice.
    They set aside and count up any brains (humans whose brains were eaten) and shotguns (humans who fought back).
    Accumulating three shotguns automatically ends a player’s turn with zero points (regardless of how many brains they had).
If they have between zero and two shotguns, they may continue rolling if they want. They may also choose to end their turn and collect one point per brain.
If the player decides to keep rolling, they must roll all the dice with footsteps.
Remember that the player must always roll three dice; they must draw more dice out of the cup if they have fewer than three footsteps to roll.
A player may keep rolling dice until either they get three shotguns—losing everything—or all 13 dice have been rolled.
A player may not reroll only one or two dice, and may not stop mid-reroll.
When someone reaches 13 brains, the rest of the players finish out the round.
The person with the most brains wins. If there’s a tie, the tied players play one last tiebreaker round.
Zombie Dice has a push-your-luck game mechanic: the more you roll the dice, the more brains you can get,
but the more likely you’ll eventually accrue three shotguns and lose everything.
Once a player reaches 13 points, the rest of the players get one more turn (to potentially catch up) and the game ends.
The player with the most points wins.
